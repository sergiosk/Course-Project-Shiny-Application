## Project Description 

This demo dataset presents the prices and other attributes from the diamonds library. 

User have the ability to filter by setting the maximum price. Moreover they may select weight of the diamond and depth percentage. These criteria can be selected through a predefined range in order for their selection to be further expanded.  Finally quality of the cut and clarity that actually measures how clean the diamond is, can be filtered as well.
